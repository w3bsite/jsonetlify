//       "I once set out to make a fiend,\nA gruesome thing that no one's seen.\nA massive gore of teeth and claws\nWith sixteen eyes and monster paws.\n\nBefore I started out to cook,\nI checked out first my Potions Book.\nWith some touches of my own,\nI knew I'd hear my monster moan.\n\nI finally found the perfect pot,\nHuge and black and rusted not,\nTo place it on a fire bright\nAnd waited for the dark of night.\n\nThe darkness came, none too soon,\nAnd in the shining of the moon,\nI began my task with hopes to fix\nThe makings for my monster mix.\n\nI filled the pot half-full with grease,\nAnd so began my monster-piece.\nI added pints of castor oil\nAnd waited for my mix to boil.\n\nI put in five potato eyes,\nA chicken's tooth and watched it rise.\nA lock of hair, a roach, a worm!\nI stirred it so it would not burn!\n\nBeetle guts, hornet's feet,\nFinger nails, rancid meat,\nA turtle's toes, a garter snake!\nSo far, this was a piece of cake!\n\nThen I put in weasel liver,\nA centipede, a caterpillar,\nSeven hairs from top a fly,\nA horse's tongue, a lizard's eye!\n\nOxen hooves and turkey neck,\nA gremlin's ear (just a speck),\nMaggot slime, a walrus knuckle.\nIt smelled so good, I had to chuckle!\n\nI listened to it curl and tip.\nI took a spoon and had a sip!\nAnd as I heard it bump and crunch,\nI settled back to have my lunch.\n\nI put the lid on good and tight.\nI let it simmer all that night.\nAnd all that day I let it brew.\nAll next night and the next day, too.\n\nThen, that night, the moment came\nTo see if I had worked in vain.\nI pried the lid with tender care,\nWondering what I'd find in there.\n\nI held my breath, peeked inside.\nI saw it...and I burst with pride!\nI threw the lid aside, at last,\nAnd danced around the pot of gas!\n\nAnd through the gas the creature rose,\nWith sixteen eyes, a big black nose,\nFangs, hair and ten inch claws,\nWarts, lice and monster paws!\n\nIt groaned! It gasped! It grunted, too!\nJust why it lived, I wish I knew!\n\"It must be luck! A chance! A fluke!\"\nI chose a name and called it, \"Duke\"!\n\n\"Here, Duke!\" I called, with outstretched hand.\nDid it really understand?\nIt did! It did! For Duke complied!\nIt looked so good, I almost cried!\n\nWith happy eyes I watched it slip,\nSquirm, slide, slither and dip.\nSlow, at first, then like a shot,\nDuke turned around....and ate the pot!\n\nIt ate the table and the chair,\nAnd my book a laying there!\nThen it ate my frying pans,\nMy overcoat and garbage cans.\n\nMy couch, my lamps, my stove, my suit!\nI have to say, it did look cute.\nBut was this the monster in my mind?\nDid I create a Frankenstein?!\n\nMy telephone and TV set,\nBut Duke? It wasn't finished yet!\nMy shower, toilet, tub and sink!\nMy sanity was at the brink!\n\nThen Duke stopped, to my surprise,\nAnd looked at me with thankful eyes.\nI never dreamed it'd be so wild!\nDuke cocked its head....and then it smiled.\n\nToday, it's eaten all I own!\nI barely even have a home!\nSo, I'm worried by one thing, you see,\nIt's that one day ... Duke ... might ... eat...\n...\"AARRGGHH!\"\n\n ",

But it is a much deeper and more biblical story than that and, like any great work of art, resists reduction. Berriault, who died in 1999, is known as a San Francisco writer. A wonderful sampling of her stories is available in Women in Their Beds: New & Selected Stories. George Saunders",

It’s about a murder – probably it’s a murder, because nothing is certain – and a love match that depends on keeping that murder secret. Like so many of Munro’s stories, this one has the scope of a novel yet never feels hurried or crowded. The sociology of a small town in rural Ontario is caught on the wing in the loose weave of her narration; the story takes in whole lifetimes, and yet its pace is also exquisitely slow, carrying us deep inside particular moments. A woman moves among the willows beside a river at night, making up her mind. Tessa Hadley",
